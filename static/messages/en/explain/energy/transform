### Terms and Conditions

The following seahorse code snippet is the part of the contract that you are about to sign.

#### Source Code

We either initialize or update your Transformer account with our contract.


##### Intialization
```python
   # Initialize a Transformer
    @instruction
    def transform(
        signer: Signer,
        mint: TokenMint,
        transformer: Empty[Transformer],
        transformer_account: Empty[TokenAccount],
        pickle: str,
    ):
        transformer_account.init(
            payer = signer,
            seeds = ['1', mint, signer],
            mint = mint,
            authority = signer,
        )
        transformer = transformer.init(
            payer = signer,
            seeds = ['energy-transformer', signer]
        )
        transformer.owner = signer.key()
        transformer.pickle = pickle
        transformer.vec_unit_gen = 0
```

##### Update

```python
    # Update a Transformer
    @instruction
    def improve_transform(
        transformer: Transformer,
        pickle: str,
        signer: Signer
    ):
    assert transformer.owner == signer.key(), 'You are not the owner of the Transformer account.'
    transformer.pickle = pickle
```

This will store the pieces of information provided in the `pickle` of the Transformer account.

This `pickle` is encrypted and can only be decrypted by us.

Those pieces of information can later be used at any point in time to access the necessary computing resources to provide users with the pieces of information they seek.

We recommend you use dedicated credentials for the purpose of this contract. We also recommend you rotate them regularly to ensure the security of your account.

You may always revoke the access of the Transformer account to the provider:
-   by closing the account,
-   by providing it with empty values,
-   or by simply revoking the credentials from your account with the provider.

If you understand and agree to the terms and conditions, please click the `Confirm` button.
