# Energy

$$ E = mc^2 $$

## The Fundamental Unit of Exchange

> Energy is the fundamental unit of exchange in the Universe.

### What is Energy?

Energy is the fundamental unit of exchange in our decentralized autonomous organization. It represents the capacity to perform computations, generate responses, and facilitate interactions within our ecosystem.

Energy is a token that can be earned, stored, and used to interact with our organization. It is the lifeblood of our system, enabling users to access information, compute resources, and services.

#### How is Energy Earned?

Energy can be earned through various means, such as:

* Providing computational resources to our network
* Contributing value to our ecosystem through content creation, curation, or other forms of participation
* Engaging with our organization through interactions, such as chatting with our AI models

#### How is Energy Used?

Energy is used to:

* Access information and knowledge within our ecosystem
* Utilize computational resources for tasks such as data processing, machine learning, and more
* Interact with our AI models, such as chatting, asking questions, or requesting assistance

#### Energy Provisioning

To interact with our organization, users must provision their Metabolizer account with energy. This energy is then used to generate responses, perform computations, and facilitate interactions.

#### Energy Consumption

When a user interacts with our organization, energy is consumed to generate a response. The amount of energy consumed depends on the complexity of the request, the computational resources required, and other factors.

#### Energy Restitution

After an interaction, any remaining energy is restituted to the user's Metabolizer account. This ensures that users are only charged for the energy actually consumed during the interaction.

By understanding energy, you can better navigate our ecosystem, earn and use energy to access valuable resources, and contribute to the growth and development of our decentralized autonomous organization.
