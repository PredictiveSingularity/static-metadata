# Sending Messages

To send a message, you need to provision your Metabolizer account with energy up to the maximum context window size of the model(s) used for the transaction.

## Provisioning Energy

You can provision energy by clicking on the "Account" tab and then clicking on the "Provision" button. You will need to specify the amount of energy you want to provision and confirm the transaction.

## Writing a Message

Once you have provisioned your Metabolizer account with energy, you can write a message in the chat interface. You can use Markdown formatting to make your message more readable.

## Sending the Message

When you are ready to send your message, click the "Send" button. The message will be processed, and a response will be generated based on the energy provisioned in your Metabolizer account.

## Example

Here is an example of how to send a message:

```markdown
# Hello World

This is a test message.
```

You can use headers, bold text, italic text, and even LaTeX equations in your message. For example:

```markdown
## Introduction

This is a **bold** text and *italic* text.
You can also use LaTeX equations: $E=mc^2$
```

Remember to keep your message concise and clear, as the energy provisioned in your Metabolizer account will be used to process the message.

## Tips

* Make sure you have enough energy provisioned in your Metabolizer account to send a message.
* Use Markdown formatting to make your message more readable.
* Keep your message concise and clear to avoid using too much energy.
* You can use the "Advanced Options" section to customize your message and energy provision.
