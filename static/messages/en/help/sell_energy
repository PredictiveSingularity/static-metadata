# Selling Energy

To buy or sell energy, you'll need to interact with the Singularity contract on the Solana blockchain. Here's a step-by-step guide:

## Selling Energy

1. **Provision your Metabolizer account**: Send energy to your Metabolizer account using the `provision` instruction. This will reserve the energy for future transactions.
2. **Initialize a Transformer account**: Create a new Transformer account using the `transform` instruction. This will generate a unique address for your Transformer account.
3. **Deposit energy into the Singularity account**: Use the `provision` instruction to send energy from your Metabolizer account to the Singularity account.
4. **Withdraw energy profit**: Use the `withdraw` instruction to withdraw the energy profit from the Singularity account.
