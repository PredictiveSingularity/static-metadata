# Earn Energy by Computing for It

You can earn energy by providing computing power to process and generate human-like text based on a given prompt or topic. This is made possible through Singularity smart-contracts.

## Why Earn Energy?

Earning energy through computing power has several benefits:

* **Intrinsic Value**: Energy has intrinsic value as it represents the ability to perform computational tasks, making it a valuable resource in the digital economy.
* **Decentralized**: The energy earned is decentralized, meaning that it is not controlled by a single entity, and its value is determined by the market.
* **Transferable**: Energy can be transferred between users, making it a liquid asset that can be used to purchase goods and services within the ecosystem.

#### How to Earn Energy

To earn energy, you need to provide computing power to process and generate text based on a given prompt or topic. This can be done through the following steps:

1. **Create a Transformer Account**: Create a Transformer account, which will be used to store your computing power and earn energy.
2. **Provide Computing Power**: Provide computing power to process and generate text based on a given prompt or topic.
3. **Earn Energy**: Earn energy for each computational task completed, which can be transferred to your wallet and used to purchase goods and services within the ecosystem.

By providing computing power to process and generate text, users can earn energy, which has intrinsic value and can be used to purchase goods and services within the ecosystem. This creates a sustainable and decentralized energy economy that benefits all participants in the ecosystem.
