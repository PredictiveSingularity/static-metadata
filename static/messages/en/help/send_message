## Welcome to Singularity

### Your Energy Companion

To get started, please make sure you have the following:

1. **Solana Wallet**: Install a Solana wallet extension, such as [Solflare](https://solflare.com) (recommended) or [Phantom](https://phantom.app).
2. **SOL Account**: Create a SOL account (if you don't already have one) and ensure it has enough SOL to cover transaction fees.
3. **Energy Account**: Your energy account will be derived from your SOL account public key. The first time you connect, you'll be prompted to sign a transaction to create it.
4. **Energy Balance**: You'll need enough energy in your energy account to send messages. You can buy energy on the crypto-market or earn it by computing for us.

Once you've met these requirements, you can write a message in the chat, and you'll be prompted to sign a transaction to provision the necessary energy. We'll then generate an answer using the chosen model and parameters, consume the tokens, and redistribute energy accordingly.

The first time you send a message, we'll additionally ask you to sign a transaction to create your Metabolizer account. This account will hold your energy reserves and facilitate transactions with Singularity.

### Tips and Reminders

* Make sure you have enough SOL to cover transaction fees.
* Keep your energy account balance topped up to avoid delays in sending messages.
* You can earn energy by computing for us (type `/help earn energy` to know more) or buying it on the crypto-market (type `/help buy energy`).
* Always review the transaction details carefully before signing.

### Getting Started

1. Connect your Solana wallet by clicking the "Connect Wallet" button.
2. Create your energy account by signing the transaction prompt.
3. Fund your energy account with enough energy to send messages.
4. Write your message in the chat, and we'll guide you through the rest of the process.

### Example Use Cases

* Ask us a question, and we'll generate an answer using the desired language model.
* Request a summary of a topic, and we'll provide a concise overview.
* Even ask us to generate creative content, like a short story or poem!

Remember, the more energy you have in your account, the more complex and detailed your requests can be. So, get started, and let's explore the possibilities of Singularity together!
